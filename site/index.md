## Current responsibilities

Since September 2007, I'm a research director at INRIA Lille. I led the RMoD Team, and now the EVREF team. During 10 years, I co-directed with O. Nierstrasz the Software Composition Group. I'm the president of ESUG. I co-founded Synectique a company that offered specific tools for Software analysis. I'm one of the leader of Pharo: a new exciting dynamic language. Check the Pharo consortium. Here is a short CV. My ORCID Number is 0000-0001-6070-6599.

## Awards and Indexes

Some people consider that h-index is not a good criterion for researcher evaluation. To me this is just one among others. Trying to understand it, it looks like it shows a bit the width of your research (i.e., that several topics got reasonance within a community). Personally, I do not work with this metrics in mind, I just try to publish the best results I have with my co-workers and thank them for their energy. According to google scholar my h-index is 63 (schoolar.g).

- I got laureate 2023 of "Prix FIEEC Bpifrance de la Recherche appliqu√©e 2023"
- I got the "Test of Time ECOOP 2023" award for _Traits: Composable Units of Behavior_
- I got the best paper award of Vissoft 2022 for _A New Generation of Class Blueprint_
- I got the Most Influential Paper of Vissoft 2013 for _Performance Evolution Blueprint_
- I got the laureate of ERC-Generator of I-Site financed by Programmes d'Investissements d'Avenir (I was the only CS researcher awarded).
- Since December 2012, I have been promoted first-class Directeur de Recherche.
- I received a "Prime d'excellence scientifique" from INRIA (2016).
- I got distinguished Visiting Fellowship Award of the Royal Academy of Engineering (2011).
- Veronica Uquillas Gomez won the Benevol Most Promising Young Research Award (2011).
- Mariano Martinez-Peck and Martin Diaz won for Fuel the 2011 ESUG Technology Award.
- Dynamic web development with Seaside: Our new free open-source Seaside book won the ESUG member 2010 best book Award.
- Michele Lanza (2003) and Alexandre Bergel (2006) PhD theses won the Ernest Denert foundation for Software Engineering Award.
- "Learning Programming with Robots" received the Award of PCPlus magazine of September 2005 and the Bitwise Recommended Award in February 2006.

## Reflection about impact and real users

Some old figures but they illustrate well my point.
- Pharo 9.0 had 790 packages for 10658 classes and 143420 methods. 
- It had around 250 forks on github https://github.com/pharo-project/pharo/ and Pharo is composed out of several github projects such as pharo-vcs, pharo-graphics, or pharo-spec. 
- Pharo has around 18 regular contributors and up to 100 occasional ones. In addition, Pharo has many users (we roughly estimate around 10 000).
-  Pharo is taught in around 30-40 universities worldwide and used by around 30 research teams. It has also an industrial consortium. Pharo runs on 11 different platforms and multiple architectures 32/64 bits, Intel/ARM. 

This raises the important question of how many citations are worth one real user (not one of our students). I do not have a definitive answer on that point, but it is important to understand that there is a __Huge__ difference between a research prototype and a real system, and Pharo is a real system with real customers. This requires a large development effort. We are lucky because Inria researcher evaluation takes this into account. Now this is an important question for funding agencies and any evaluation of my team.
