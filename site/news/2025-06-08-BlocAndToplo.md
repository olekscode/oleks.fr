We are continuing our journey with Pharo and I hope that with Pharo 14 we will release the new graphical stack for Pharo. 
If you want to know more let me know. Here is some information:

## Two large libraries 

- [Bloc](http://github.com/pharo-graphics/bloc) is the base layer (basically Morphic low-level replacement)

```	
http://github.com/pharo-graphics/bloc
```

- [Toplo](http://github.com/pharo-graphics/toplo) is a fully skinnable widget set inspired from [https://ant.design](https://ant.design).  A. Plantec is doing a gorgeous implementation.

### Acknowledgments

All this work is sponsored by Thales, which uses it to design and prototype UX. 
A public example is an interactive sales application for Thales with an old version of Bloc and Toplo [See on youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5qaFM2F3J0). They presented it at ESUG 2023 at Lyon.
