# About Cormas

Cormas is implemented in Pharo.

[Pharo](http://www.pharo.org) is a beautiful dynamically-typed reflective pure object-oriented language that we have been developing since 2008.
It is inspired by Smalltalk (I'm extremely grateful to Alan Kay and Dan Ingalls - they were so visionary and right). Now our vision for Pharo is to reinvent Smalltalk and produce a better system. 
From that perspective, I'm used to say that Pharo is what we have and not what we want. 
In essence, Pharo is the beginning of the journey and not the final goal. And you can change its future.

_Some nice testimonies._ You can check what companies using Pharo are saying about Pharo: [Video](https://youtu.be/6tdkKNX2g4s)
